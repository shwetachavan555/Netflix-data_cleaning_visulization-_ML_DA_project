# Netflix-data_cleaning_visulization-_ML_DA_project
This project involves loading, cleaning,  analyzing, and visualizing data from a Netflix dataset. We'll use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn towork through the project. The goal is to explore the dataset, derive insights, and prepare for potential machine learning tasks.

The most fundamental split in the library is between Movies and TV Shows.
  Key Insight: Movies significantly outnumber TV Shows on the platform.
Observation: The "Distribution of Content by Type" chart shows that Netflix’s strategy has historically leaned more heavily toward cinematic releases, though TV Shows represent a growing and highly engaged segment of the library.
